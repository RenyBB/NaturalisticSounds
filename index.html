// Task description
/* Participants will hear pairs of sounds and have to say which sound (1st or 2nd) is higher in pitch.
   The task consists of training phase (2 trials) and test phase (30 trials).
   In the training phase participants receive feedback whether their response was correct or incorrect.
   There is no feedback in the test phase. On some trials in the test phase participants are also asked an additional subjective rating question.
   There are 4 different subejctive question. Each is repeated twice.
*/

// NOTE: the stimuli are located in Stimuli/PitchDiscrimination
// There are 2 js files in that are used to load the stimuli: PitchDiscrimination_TestStimuli and PitchDiscrimination_TrainingStimuli

// TO DO
/*
(1) Feedback at the end of the task: this corresponds to the number of correct responses in the test phase. I have added the code to count the number of correct responses at the end, but it doesn't work.
(2) The raw data is a bit hideous, I have to tidy it up.
