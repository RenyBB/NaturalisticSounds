// Task description
/* Participants will hear pairs of sounds and have to say which sound (1st or 2nd) is higher in pitch.
   The task consists of training phase (2 trials) and test phase (30 trials).
   In the training phase participants receive feedback whether their response was correct or incorrect.
   There is no feedback in the test phase. On some trials in the test phase participants are also asked an additional subjective rating question.
   There are 4 different subejctive question. Each is repeated twice.
*/

// NOTE: the stimuli are located in Stimuli/PitchDiscrimination
// There are 2 js files in that are used to load the stimuli: PitchDiscrimination_TestStimuli and PitchDiscrimination_TrainingStimuli

// TO DO
/*
(1) Feedback at the end of the task: this corresponds to the number of correct responses in the test phase. I have added the code to count the number of correct responses at the end, but it doesn't work.
(2) The raw data is a bit hideous, I have to tidy it up.

                     Researchers have found that emotions influence how we track time. For example,it has been found that images which cause intense negative emotions 
                     are perceived to be shown for longer than images which don’t elicit any emotion, while images which cause intense positive emotions are perceived 
                     as shorter. In this task, we are investigating whether these effects also occur for sounds which generate positive and negative emotions 
                     with different intensity.<br><br>
                     The reason we didn’t tell you about the aim of the task at the beginning is because paying attention to time affects how we perceive time. For example, when people are engaged in a task (like solving a puzzle) and simultaneously track the passage of time, they report that less time has passed the more engaging the task is.
                     In contrast, when people are unexpectedly asked to reflect on how much time has passed, they report that more time has passed the more engaging the task they were doing is.<br><br>
